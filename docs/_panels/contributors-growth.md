This panel aims at providing a view of the contributors, their evolution and their growth
over time. This information is provided for all of the data sources and gives a glimpse about
the differences between the periods of analysis. The information can be filtered by data 
source, by organization and by project.


## Metrics
From left to right and top to bottom, the metrics provided are:

* **Total Contributors**: total number of unique contributors in any data source.
* **Active Contributors over time and Growth Analysis**: evolutionary chart displaying the
  number of active contributors in all of the data sources and the differences between each
  timeslot of analysis. The line represents the net number of contributors. The bar charts
  displays the difference between that timeslot and the previous one. If the difference is
  positive, so there's a growth in the number of contributors, the bar is green, otherwise
  the bar is yellow.
* **Contributors Growth by Data Source**:  this table displays the several data sources of
  analysis and the number of contributors in each of them.
* **Active Contributors over time and Difference with the Average**: evolutionary chart
  displaying the number of active contributors in all of the data sources and the difference
  between the average of contributors for the analyzed period and how far a timeslot is from
  that average. The green line represents the net number of contributors. The bar charts 
  displays how far each of the slots of time in number of contributors are from the average. 
  The average is represented as a horizontal line in red color. This displays the average 
  number of contributors for the period of analysis.

In addition to Kibana filters and search box ont top, filtering by `Data Source`,
`Organization` and/or `Project` is allowed by using the top left corner widget.
